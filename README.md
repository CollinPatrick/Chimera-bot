# Chimera-bot
The Chimera discord bot

This is a discord bot concept I had. The code here works, but is not build for scale.
The idea behind this bot is to make it the bot of all bots by allowing users to create their own bot commands in the form of modules that could be installed to a server via commands or the online dashboard. Due to the scope of the project and lack of time, I decided to shelve this project and made it public as a portfolio piece.
